# DATA GOES BELOW
# We have set this up for you, but you will need to test your program by
# compiling and running it several times with different input data values
# (different integers placed at addresses a, b, x, y and z)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------

INPUTS>
a:    dc -1    # replace these five numbers
b:    dc 1     # by your choice of integers
x:    dc 5     # for testing purposes
y:    dc 3
z:    dc 7

ans:  ds 1     # one byte reserved for the result
